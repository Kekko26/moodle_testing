### 3.6.3 ###

* Currently supported versions are highlighted in green.
* Clicking the "Moodle App" button below the component selector sets the filter so
  that only the strings used by the mobile app are selected for translation.
* A new option "latest available version" can be used instead of selecting particular
  moodle versions. When selected, the filter picks the most recent version for each of
  the selected component.
* A new filtering option "only strings used in the Moodle App" is available.
* Strings used in the Mobile App have a little phone icon displayed.

Credit goes to Pau Ferrer for contributing these improvements.
